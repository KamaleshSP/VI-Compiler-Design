# Compiler Design Laboratory

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains the laboratory programs for the **Compiler Design** course.  
The work is organized into multiple labs, starting with a **practice session (Lab 0)** followed by the **actual compiler design experiments from Lab 1 onwards**.

Each lab focuses on a specific phase or concept of compiler construction, implemented using the **C programming language**.

---

## Lab Classification

- **Lab 0** → Practice Session (C programming fundamentals for compiler labs)
- **Lab 1 onwards** → Actual Compiler Design Experiments

## Lab Details

### Lab 0 – String Operations in C (Practice Session)

**Purpose:**  
Lab 0 is a **practice lab** designed to refresh essential C programming concepts required for compiler design experiments.<br>

**Programs Covered:**
- String Reversal
- String Length Calculation
- String Comparison

**Concepts Reinforced:**
- Character arrays
- String handling
- Built-in vs manual logic
- Loops and conditionals

> Detailed documentation is available inside `Lab0/README.md`.<br>

---

### Lab 1 – Lexical Analyzer in C

**Purpose:**  
Lab 1 marks the **beginning of actual compiler design experiments** and focuses on implementing a **Lexical Analyzer**, which is the **first phase of a compiler**.<br>

**Program Covered:**
- Identification of tokens such as:
  - Keywords
  - Identifiers
  - Operators
  - Integers
  - Delimiters

**Key Concepts:**
- Lexical analysis
- Tokenization
- Pattern recognition
- String and character processing

> Detailed documentation is available inside `Lab1/README.md`.<br>

---

### Lab n (Future Lab)
**Purpose:**

**Program Covered:**

**Key Concepts:**

---

## Compilation & Execution

All programs are written in **C** and can be compiled using **GCC**.<br>

**Example:**<br>
gcc program.c -o program<br>
./program<br>

> Executable files (`.exe`) are intentionally ignored in GitHub using `.gitignore`.

### Learning Outcomes
By completing all labs in this repository, you will:
- Understand the phases of a compiler<br>
- Implement core compiler components in C<br>
- Gain practical experience with lexical and syntax analysis<br>
- Strengthen problem-solving and system-level programming skills<br>

---

### Notes
- Each lab folder contains its own detailed README.md
- This repository is structured for academic evaluation and GitHub presentation
- Future labs will follow the same documentation and coding standards
